# What this tutorial is about

#draft - rewrite it later

Hi dear scientist! We are glad to see that you decided to go on the road to an adventure in computational biology. We want you to not get lost, and give you some tips and tricks on how to use the cluster and what are the best practices we are trying to use to keep our work organized.

We believe that standardization of work processes is good for reproducibility in data science and make it much easier to collaborate on projects.

Here, in the next hour or two, you will learn how to keep your data organized and structured, so that if you leave, your colleagues could continue working on your project without any delays. We believe that the best way to learn it is actually just to try to do it. That is why this tutorial is designed in a way, that you do a small project - RNA-seq analysis. Even if you are not particularly interested in this specific type of data, it serves as a good example and we can demonstrate different aspects of data and environment management, organization of work, and so on. At the same time, we try to split the whole process into independent sections, one covering one particular aspect of the work so that it would be easier to search for a particular piece of information.

So, you want to connect to the cluster to run RStudio, or process your NGS data, how do you do that? Let's set up your machine first.
